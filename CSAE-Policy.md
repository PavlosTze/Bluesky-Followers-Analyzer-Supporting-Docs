Last Updated: 17/01/2025

**1. Introduction**
Bluesky Unfollowers Tracker is a utility app designed to help users track their followers and unfollowers on the Bluesky platform. While our app does not function as a social media platform or facilitate user-generated content, we remain committed to preventing and reporting any instances of child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE).

**2. Zero Tolerance for CSAE**
We have a strict zero-tolerance policy for any content, activities, or behaviors related to child sexual abuse and exploitation. If we become aware of any such violations, we will take immediate action, including reporting to appropriate authorities.

**3. Prevention and Monitoring**
    Our app does not host, store, or facilitate the sharing of user-generated content.
    We do not allow any interactions between users within our platform that could lead to CSAE-related activities.
    If any CSAE-related content is detected in external links or third-party integrations, we will take necessary action to block access and report it.

**4. Reporting Mechanism**
If you encounter any concerns regarding CSAE related to our app, please contact us immediately at:

We will investigate all reports and, where applicable, escalate the issue to relevant child protection authorities, such as the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) or law enforcement agencies.

**5. Compliance and Cooperation**
We comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding child safety, including Google Playâ€™s Developer Program Policies. We actively cooperate with law enforcement and child protection organizations to address any CSAE concerns.

**6. Updates to This Policy**
We may update this policy periodically to align with legal requirements and best practices. Please review it regularly to stay informed.
